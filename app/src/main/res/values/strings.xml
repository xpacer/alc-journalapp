    <string name="detail_content_text">It is the second day in my new school in Ede, Osun state. Osun is really different from Lagos. I am in Primary Four now and Mummy Ede calls me a big girl. I want to tell her I am still a small child, I am only eight. I like the school. It is not as big but it is more beautiful than Agege Primary where I attended before I came here. I like my new teacher too. Mrs Kolawole is beautiful and smiles a lot and she doesnâ€™t shout at us or leave the class to gossip with other teachers.</string>
